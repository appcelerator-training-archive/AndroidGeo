Demo of Android geolocation techniques in Titanium

1. Download
2. Import into Titanium Studio
3. Update Titanium SDK version in app.js. This sample should work in any of the 2.x or 3.x branches. But I've tested it only in 2.1.4GA and 3.0.0GA
4. Build and run on an Android device (it won't run properly in the emulator)
